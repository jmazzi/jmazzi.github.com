title: Replaced the woot tracker
---
I've replaced the [WootOff Script](/archives/2006/08/18/woot-woofoff-script/) with a [Rails application](http://woot.r00tshell.com). It works just fine with the daily sales, but I have to wait for the next WootOff before I can say it's good to go. The source code is up on [github](http://github.com/jmazzi/woot-watch). Let me know if you hit any issues with it.
