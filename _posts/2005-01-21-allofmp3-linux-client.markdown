This script is for downloading songs you put in your download cart from [allofmp3.com](http://www.allofmp3.com/index2.shtml?affiliate=rshell). All you need to do is add an album to your cart, then run this script:
<cite>
./all_of_mp3.php "Folder_to_download_to"
</cite>

You will need to have curl compiled into php for this to work. I hope to later make one in python with a GTK interface with more options. If you are interested in this, let me know.
