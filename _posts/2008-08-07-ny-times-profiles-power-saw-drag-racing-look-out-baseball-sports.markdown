â€¨ Today, the New York Times took a close look at the fast-paced world of [power tool drag racing](http://gizmodo.com/5021069/power-tool-drag-racing-is-our-kind-of-non+sport). The inherent fun of placing lightly modified power tools on the ground and watching them tear off down the street was not lost on them, apparently. Will attention from such a big publication make power tool drag racing a more mainstream sport? One can only hope. The Times even links to all sorts of how-to's from sites like [Instructables](http://instructables.com/) and [Make](http://blog.makezine.com/). Get on board now, before ESPN ruins it! \[[NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/07/technology/personaltech/07basics.html)\]
