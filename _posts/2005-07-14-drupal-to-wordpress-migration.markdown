title: Drupal to Wordpress Migration
---
I have once again migrated to a new CMS. [Last time](/archives/2005/02/13/civicspace_drupal_migration/), it was just civicspace to drupal, so it wasn't a big deal. This time, I have went from drupal to [wordpress](http://wordpress.org). Drupal was just too much for what I am doing, and I really like the feature set for wordpress. I've managed to migrated users, posts, comments, and downloads. Plus, I wrote a dynamic node redirect system. This way, old links like /node/71 will be auto-mapped to the new posts and send a 301 Permanently moved responses. Hopefully this will keep my search engine results the same. If anyone wants details on how to do this, just let me know and i would be happy post the converter. Otherwise, I'm not gonna bother creating a write up if no one needs such a thing.
