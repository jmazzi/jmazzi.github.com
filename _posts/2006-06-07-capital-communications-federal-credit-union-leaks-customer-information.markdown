title: Capital Communications Federal Credit Union Leaks Customer Information
---
Today I checked my email to find the following in my inbox from my bank located in Albany, NY:
June 7, 2006

>Dear Justin Mazzi,
>
>Capital Communications Federal Credit Union has engaged Cathedral Corporation as our paper and electronic statement processor. Cathedral creates and delivers all member statements on a monthly basis. In May, Cathedral performed some programming modifications that resulted in certain account statements being mailed to household addresses containing randomly generated account information and/or activity. We ask that you shred this information and rely entirely on your e-statement as we are confident this information is correct.
>
>We have established additional verification controls to insure the protection, security and confidentiality of your account information. The erroneous paper statement does not contain enough identifying information to allow access to any of our members' accounts. If, for any reason, you are still uncomfortable with the status of your account, we will convert your existing account to a new number and make arrangements for all corresponding details. Please email us at statements@capcomfcu.org or call our Call Center immediately at (800) 468-5500 Option 2 should you request your accounts to be converted.
>
>I want to assure you that on behalf of the members of Capital Communications we are investigating whether to continue to utilize this vendor as we take this error very seriously. In the meantime, we are confident that the internal precautions that we have undertaken will provide the highest level of protection of your assets. Again, if you are uncomfortable in any way with the error that has taken place, we will immediately upon notification from you, provide a new account number and take care of all changes necessary.
>
>We offer our sincerest apology for this situation and assure you that our continued focus is to maintain the integrity of our members' data and the manner in which it is delivered to you. If you have further questions regarding this situation, please contact me at (518) 458-2195 extension 3204.

>Sincerely,
>
>Paula A. Stopera
