title: Allofmp3 Linux Client Python Version
---
Here is another version written in python for [allofmp3](http://www.allofmp3.com/index2.shtml?affiliate=rshell):

[http://r00tshell.com/svn/allofmp3/tags/1.0.0/all_of_mp3.py](/static/all_of_mp3.py)

This version requires [pycurl](http://pycurl.sourceforge.net). This just makes us one step closer to a GTK version with more features. I currently do not program in GTK, so its more of an experiament. If you do know GTK and want to help me out, please let me know.
