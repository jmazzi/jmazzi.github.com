title: New DNS Control Out
---
[DNS Control 1.0.2](/dns-control/) has been released.. This one comes with a cool new feature. I haven't had a whole lot of time to work on this lately, but I will get to the [Feature Requests](/defects/) as soon as I have time.

On a side note, I only need one more person to signup and complete an offer for my [free PSP](http://ipodnanos.freepay.com/?r=32250495). If you like DNS Control, you can help me out by signing up. I have already received a free iPod from this company, so its definitely legit. So signup up and get yourself a free PSP in the process.
