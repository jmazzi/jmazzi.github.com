title: BrainCast Beta - Free Internet and Phone Based Memo Recording
---
I canâ€™t tell you how many times I have been out somewhere and have had an idea that just faded away because I didnt take the time to leave myself a reminder (how often do you have a pen handy?). Now we have BrainCast. When I think of something I need to get done, I take my cellphone out of my pocket, hit a few buttons, and presto! Now I can remember everything.
