title: Easter Egg Hunt
---
We had an Easter Egg Hunt at [work](http://www.nocblog.com/index.php/companynews/2005/03/28/call_him_the_easter_bunny) today. At 1:45pm Brendan and John kicked us out of the [office](http://www.hostrocket.com/about/data_center.htm). After about 15 minutes, we were all instructed to find the hidden Easter eggs. The eggs were all found in about 10 minutes or so. I was the winner with a grand total of 10 eggs. Unfortunately, Mike got the egg with the "You're Fired!" note in it.
