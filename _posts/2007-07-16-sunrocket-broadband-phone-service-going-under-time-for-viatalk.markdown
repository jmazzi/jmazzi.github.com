---
SunRocket is going out of business! Check out [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/business/17sunrocket.html?ref=technology). Or, you can follow along this [thread on dslreports](http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,18660180~days=9999). If you are a current SunRocket customer, [ViaTalk](http://www.myreferer.com/mydb/?M=viatalk&amp;ID=jmazzi&amp;L=2) is offering a contract buyout for up to a FULL YEAR! Plus, you get 3 months free and a second line, for no charge. You can't beat that with a stick. [Signup!](http://www.myreferer.com/mydb/?M=viatalk&amp;ID=jmazzi&amp;L=2)
