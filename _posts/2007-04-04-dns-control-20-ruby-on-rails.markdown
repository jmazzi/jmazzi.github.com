title: DNS Control 2.0 - Ruby on Rails
---
Over the past year, I have had the pleasure of working with [ruby on rails](http://rubyonrails.org) professionally. It's been a lot of fun. The development process has been cut in half for the apps I have written. It has also been easier to maintain. How does this apply to [DNS Control](/dns-control)? I'm glad you asked! DNS Control 2.0 will be written entirely in ruby on rails. Right now, I am just planning things out. If you interested in helping, feel free to send me an at <incoming1@mailheist.com>. Stay tuned for updates!
