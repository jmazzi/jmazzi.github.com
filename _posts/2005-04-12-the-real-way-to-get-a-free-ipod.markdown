title: The real way to get a Free ipod
---
Recently, someone told me about a site which helps you get a freeipod. It actually works which is a shock. To quote them

"No doubt you've all heard of the Gratis Network giveaway deals: sign up, complete a (sometimes) free offer, refer a 'few' friends, and get a free computer/ipod/TV. Assuming you do everything correctly, you do in fact get the advertised item. The first two steps are relatively easy, but it's the referral part that's hard. None of your friends are all that reliable, and they think you're trying to scam them... that's where the conga line comes in.

The equal opportunity conga is a list of people who have signed up for the Gratis Network Free ipod offer through [THIS LINK](http://ipodnanos.freepay.com/?r=32250495). Every 12 hours, the link will change so that a randomly selected person on the list gets the credit for people who sign up. In other words, every 12 hours another person will be getting a free computer once this site picks up some steam."

So you wanna a free ipod, just signup here
[http://freeipods.com](http://ipodnanos.freepay.com/?r=32250495)

then email 1macminiconga@gmail.com saying you have completed an offer along with your freeipod link. Thats it!
