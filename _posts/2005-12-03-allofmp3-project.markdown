title: Allofmp3 Project
---
Since there has been a bunch of people developing clients based on the code I wrote for [allofmp3](http://www.allofmp3.com/index2.shtml?affiliate=rshell), I decided I would like to setup a central development project to keep all the efforts in one place. If you are one of those people, please contact me: jmazzi@gmail--------.com(remove the --------). I'd like to come with a cross platform solution. GTK+Python sounds like a good idea to me. Please send me your feedback.
