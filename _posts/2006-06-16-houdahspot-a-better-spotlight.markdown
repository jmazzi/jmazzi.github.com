title: HoudahSpot - A better spotlight
---
Spotlight is great for a quick search now and then. But lets face it, it can be slow and its search options are far and few between. Sometimes you need to find a file of a certain type or from a certain date.

This is where [HoudahSpot](http://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot) comes into play. The software is $14.95, but [MacZOT.com](http://maczot.com/) is giving you an opportunity to get for free today. I invite you to come by, try out software, and blog your own thoughts about the software.
